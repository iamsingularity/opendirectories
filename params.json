{"name":"Opendirectories","tagline":"wget, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS and Google","body":"# Opendirectories\r\n... is a bunch of tools to help facilitate [search](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/opendirectories/tree/master/opendirectories) and [acquisition](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/opendirectories/tree/master/downloader) of data.\r\n\r\n## Search data\r\n... through a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/opendirectories/tree/master/opendirectories/chrome) or a [Firefox Add-on](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/opendirectories/tree/master/opendirectories/firefox). \r\n\r\nThe Chrome Extension has more features. The Add-on search is pretty basic, but gets the job done.\r\n\r\n### How to install the Chrome Extension\r\n- go to `chrome://extensions`\r\n- check `Developer mode` *(top right)*\r\n- click `Load unpacked extension...` *(top left)*\r\n- point it to the extension *(the folder with the manifest.json file)*\r\n- click `Select`\r\n\r\n### How to install the Firefox Add-on\r\n- go to `about:addons`\r\n- click settings button next to the search field *(top right)* and select `Install Add-on From File...`\r\n- point it to the extension *(the folder with the manifest.json file)*\r\n- click `Open`\r\n\r\n## Acquire data\r\n... through a [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/opendirectories/tree/master/downloader/chrome/downloader) and a [Rails 4 App](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/opendirectories/tree/master/downloader/rails/downloader). It handles regular URLs, BBC iPlayer videos and Youtube videos.\r\n\r\nInstall the Extension like above. Somewhere in the sources there's a `SERVER` and `PORT` constant. Change it to your needs. There's a `build.sh` to help you out afterwards.\r\n\r\nDeploy the Rails 4 App like any other app.\r\nThe Rails 4 App requires both [get_iplayer](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer) and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) to do the heavy lifting. [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque) does the queue handling.\r\n\r\n## Scripts\r\nTwo scripts that are basically a wrapper around `wget` and `get_iplayer`.","google":"UA-65963364-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
